Welcome to the "Awesome Claude Prompts" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the Claude model.

The [Claude](https://claude.ai/) model is an AI assistant created by [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/) that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt. 

[Claude](https://claude.ai/) offers many amazing features that [ChatGPT](https://ai.com) does not support, such as longer contexts (up to 100k), free file uploading, etc., making it more powerful than ChatGPT. 

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with Claude. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/yzfly/awesome-claude-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use Claude to generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for Claude. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun using Claude!
